## Hi there 👋

**shahadat-islam0/shahadat-islam0** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

# Hey, I'm Rozo! 🚀

Embarking on my GitHub adventure like a noob hunter in Demon Slayer – zero kills yet, but sharpening my blade! No projects? No problem. I'm here to learn, laugh, and level up in the world of code and creativity.

## About Me
Fresh out of the tutorial zone, I'm obsessed with **AI fundamentals** – think unraveling the mysteries of machine learning, one concept at a time. My secret weapon? **AI video editing knowledge** – I geek out on tools that turn raw footage into epic montages. Oh, and I'm dipping my toes into **Python** – scripting simple stuff while binge-watching anime. Life's too short for boring bios, so here's a quirky fact: I once tried editing a video with AI to make my cat look like a demon slayer... results were hilariously chaotic! 😹

## What I'm Up To
- **Learning Mode**: Exploring GitHub repos on AI basics and video tools. Goal: Build a portfolio that screams "hire this quirky innovator!"
- **Interests**: Anime marathons (Demon Slayer and Solo Leveling top the list), tinkering with Python for fun scripts, and dreaming up AI-powered edits that bend reality.
- **Humor Alert**: Why did the AI break up with the video editor? It couldn't handle the "cut" scenes! (Okay, I'll stick to coding puns from now on.)

## Future Quests (Goals)
Not 100% mapped out yet – that's the fun part! Aiming to create my first repo soon, maybe a Python script for AI video tweaks or an anime recommendation bot. Open to mentors, collabs, or just chatting about epic plot twists. If you're into AI, editing, or bad jokes, hit me up!
